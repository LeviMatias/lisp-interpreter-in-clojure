# lisp-interpreter-in-clojure

2020 - Class Assignment

This program works under a simple read-eval print loop (repl function) which delegates the different tasks to the corresponding functions. The main goal of this project was to emulate a Lisp interpreter made completely in clojure. It currently has support for math and list operations.

to run(requires clojure to be installed):
>
>clj
>
>(load-file "tlc-lisp-main.clj")
>
>(repl)
>
TLC Lisp folder contains the corresponding version of Lisp this program is trying to emulate.
