# lisp-interpreter-in-clojure

2020 - Class Assignment

This program works under a simple read-eval print loop which delegates the different operations to the corresponding funcions. The main goal of this project was to emulate a Lisp interpreter made completely in clojure.

TLC Lisp folder contains the corresponding version of Lisp this program is trying to emulate.
